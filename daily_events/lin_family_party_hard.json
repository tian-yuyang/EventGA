        "Mei Lin": "Mei Lin is planning to have a party at Lin's family house with Eddy Lin and John Lin from 5 pm to 7 pm. All three should be there during that time. Mei Lin should bring the cake and bread to the party. Eddy and John do not know about the party, so before the party begin, Mei Lin should look for Eddy and John to tell them about the time and place for the party."
